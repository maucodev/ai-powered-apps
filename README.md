# AI-Powered Apps

A full-stack application developed as part of [Mosh Hamedani's course on building AI-powered apps](https://codewithmosh.com/p/build-ai-powered-apps). This project demonstrates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with modern web technologies to create practical AI features.

## Features

- **Chatbot**: An interactive chatbot designed for an imaginary theme park, providing instant answers to visitor queries such as ride recommendations for kids, food options, and park hours. Built with a clean architecture backend and a responsive frontend.

- **Review Summarizer**: A tool that analyzes and condenses customer reviews into concise, actionable insights, helping users make informed decisions quickly.

## Technologies Used

- Bun (runtime and package manager)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- shadcn/ui (UI components)
- Prisma (database ORM)
- Hugging Face and Ollama (for integrating open-source LLMs)
- Prompt engineering techniques for effective AI interactions
